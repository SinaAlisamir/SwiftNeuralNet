This is a simple implementation of a fully connected neural network in swift.</br>

You can simple run the following codes in your terminal to see how it works:</br>

swiftc Demo.swift</br>
./Demo</br>

If you want to use it in your project just drag and drop the 'NeuralNet.swift' file into your project and see the demo function in 'Demo.swift' file for how to use it.</br>
